### Abstract
Originally developed for computer vision, Generative Advarsarial Nets (GANs) have achieved great success in producing real-valued data. While these nets bypass a lot of the problems associated with more widely used models based on maximum-likelihood approaches, it remains a challenge to successfully train them for tasks involving discrete outputs, such as text summarization. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training approach for an abstractive text summarization task: generating headlines for WikiHow articles. We make use of two models participating in a contest to outperform each other â€” an encoder-decoder generator a discriminator. We train these with respect to two different loss functions and evaluate the resulting model's performance using ROUGE metrics. In particular, we see an improvement by 25.9 \% in ROUGE-1 and 42.6 \% in ROUGE-2 of our proposed adversarially-trained model as compared to  baseline seq2seq models.
